# Scheduler_with_buddy_system_allocation

-- This project is a "Scheduler" that manages the running and waiting processes in the operating system besides memory allocation simulation.
  This scheduler runs by 3 different algorithms, the user can only choose one at execution.
  The available algorithms are :
                                1- Highest Priority First (HPF)
                                2- Round Robin (RR)
                                3- Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)
In addition, memeory allocation was taking into consideration using buddy system alloction technique.

 The user has to run ./pg_out at the terminal
  then, he is asked to choose one algorithm to apply to the processes.
 The processes' information must be saved at .txt file named "processes.txt" with the header and format attached in "processes.txt" file in this repository.
